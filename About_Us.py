My application is designed to help users navigate Singaporeâ€™s traffic regulations, specifically focusing on the demerit point system and vocational license application process. This interactive chatbot solution consolidates information from trusted resources, providing accurate and up-to-date guidance.

**Project Scope**
The project addresses the lack of a centralized, user-friendly tool for accessing information on traffic penalties and licensing processes in Singapore. Our aim is to bridge this gap by offering two key functionalities:

- Demerit Point Chatbot: Users can inquire about specific traffic violations and receive detailed responses on associated demerit points and penalties.
- Vocational Driving License Application Chatbot: Provides step-by-step instructions for users interested in applying for Private Vocational Driver's License (PVDL), including eligibility, documentation, and fees.

**Objectives**

- Enable citizens to seamlessly access and understand traffic rules and regulations.

- Improve transparency and accessibility by consolidating data from multiple official sources.

- Customize the information flow based on user inputs, ensuring relevance and accuracy.

**Data Sources**

Our data sources are collected from reputable, official websites to ensure that the information is accurate and reliable. Here are the primary data sources used:

- Land Transport Authority (LTA) of Singapore: https://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/onemotoring/home/driving/vocational_licence/vocational_licence_application.html

- Singapore Governmentâ€™s Traffic Offenses Page: https://www.police.gov.sg/Advisories/Traffic/Traffic-Matters/Penalties-for-Traffic-Offences

- Vocational License Information from private hires and operators such as Grab and Gojek, and training courses available for PVDL such as Taxi Driver Vocational Licence Course and PDVL course offered by NTUC Learning Hub.

**Features**

- Interactive Chatbots powered by AI to deliver responses specific to each use case.

- Real-time Data Retrieval: Fetches the latest regulations and guidelines from the sources mentioned above, ensuring users receive the most up-to-date information.
