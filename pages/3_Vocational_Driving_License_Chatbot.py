"""
The Vocational License Registration Chatbot is an AI-powered assistant designed to guide users through the process of applying for vocational licenses in Singapore, specifically for roles such as private hire car drivers, taxi drivers, and bus operators. This chatbot is tailored to answer questions, provide step-by-step guidance, and clarify requirements set by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) for obtaining a vocational license.

**Key Features**

- License Information by Category üìù: The chatbot helps users understand the different types of vocational licenses available‚ÄîPrivate Hire Car Driver's Vocational License (PDVL), Taxi Driver's Vocational License (TDVL), and Bus Driver's Vocational License (BDVL). Users can select their intended license type, and the chatbot provides specific information relevant to that category.

- Application Requirements Checklist üìã: Users receive detailed information on prerequisites such as minimum age, driving experience, medical examinations, background checks, and mandatory training courses. This ensures that applicants know exactly what they need before applying.

- Step-by-Step Application Guidance üë£: The chatbot walks users through each stage of the application process, from eligibility requirements and course registration to document submission and final licensing.

- Quick Access to Official Resources üåê: The chatbot provides direct links to official LTA resources, such as online application portals, training provider websites, and FAQs, so users can easily access additional information or start their application directly.

- Interactive Q&A ü§ñ: Users can ask specific questions about any part of the licensing process. For example:

User: "How long does it take to get a PDVL?"

Chatbot: "It typically takes 4-6 weeks, including the time needed to complete mandatory training and exams."
